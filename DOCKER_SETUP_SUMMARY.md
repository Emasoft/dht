# Docker Setup Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Dockerfile Python Environment ✅
- Created multi-stage Dockerfile with proper Python environment setup
- Fixed virtual environment path issues  
- Added proper environment variables for Python execution
- Created a simplified test Dockerfile that works correctly

### 2. Created Test Profiles ✅
- Updated `tests/conftest.py` with test profiles:
  - **local**: Full testing with high retries and timeouts
  - **ci**: Fast testing for GitHub Actions
  - **docker**: Optimized for container execution
- Added automatic test skipping based on profile
- Added custom pytest markers (slow, network, docker, integration)

### 3. Fixed Virtual Environment Issues ✅
- Resolved Python path configuration in containers
- Fixed module import issues
- Ensured proper activation of virtual environment
- Verified with test script showing successful imports

### 4. Added Integration Test ✅
- Created `tests/integration/test_github_clone_setup.py`
- Tests cloning a GitHub repo and setting it up with `dhtl setup`
- Tests building the project with `dhtl build`
- Includes Docker-specific test variant

### 5. Updated Docker Compose ✅
- Fixed volume mounts and environment variables
- Added proper Python path configuration
- Set up test profile environment variable
- Configured working directory correctly

### 6. Created Environment Configurations ✅
- Test profiles automatically configure:
  - Retry counts (local: 10, ci: 2, docker: 3)
  - Timeouts (local: 60s, ci: 5s, docker: 10s)
  - Test skipping rules
  - Temporary directory locations

### 7. Docker Test Execution ✅
- Created `run_docker_tests.py` for comprehensive test execution
- Successfully built working Docker test image (`dht:test-simple`)
- Verified tests run correctly in containers
- Tests pass with proper environment detection

## Key Files Created/Modified

1. **Dockerfile** - Multi-stage build with test runner stage
2. **docker-compose.yml** - Service definitions with proper configs
3. **tests/conftest.py** - Test profiles and fixtures
4. **tests/integration/test_github_clone_setup.py** - GitHub clone test
5. **run_docker_tests.py** - Docker test runner script

## Usage

### Run tests in Docker:
```bash
# Build test image
docker build -f Dockerfile.test -t dht:test-simple .

# Run all tests
docker run --rm dht:test-simple python -m pytest -v

# Run specific test
docker run --rm dht:test-simple python -m pytest -v tests/unit/test_dhtl_commands.py

# Use Docker Compose
docker compose run --rm dht-test
```

### Test Profiles:
```bash
# Local testing (default)
pytest -v

# CI testing
DHT_TEST_PROFILE=ci pytest -v

# Docker testing (automatic in containers)
docker run --rm dht:test-simple pytest -v
```

## Next Steps

The Docker setup is now robust and ready for use. The test environment properly detects whether it's running locally, in CI, or in Docker containers, and adjusts behavior accordingly.
