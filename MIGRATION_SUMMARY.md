# DHT Migration to Python CLI - Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Complete Replacement of Shell Entry Points
- **Removed**: `dhtl.sh` and `dhtl.bat` 
- **Created**: `dhtl.py` - A pure Python replacement that:
  - Handles all environment setup
  - Works cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
  - Executes bash modules through temporary wrapper scripts
  - Maintains backward compatibility with all existing commands

### 2. PyPI Package Structure
- **Package Name**: `dht-toolkit`
- **Entry Points**: 
  - `dhtl` - Main command
  - `dht` - Alternative alias
- **Clean Build**: Successfully builds wheel and source distributions
- **Dependencies**: All properly configured in `pyproject.toml`

### 3. Key Files

#### dhtl.py (Main Entry Point)
- Python launcher that replaces bash scripts
- Handles platform detection
- Sets up environment variables
- Executes shell modules through orchestrator

#### dhtl_cli.py (PyPI Wrapper)
- Click-based CLI interface
- Provides structured command definitions
- Calls dhtl.py for execution
- Installed globally via pip

### 4. Installation Methods

```bash
# Via pip
pip install dht-toolkit

# Via UV (fast)
uv pip install dht-toolkit

# From source
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dht.git
cd dht
pip install -e .
```

### 5. Testing Results

✅ Package builds successfully
✅ Installs via pip
✅ Global `dhtl` command works
✅ All commands accessible
✅ Cross-platform support maintained

## Migration Complete

The DHT toolkit is now a proper Python package ready for PyPI distribution while maintaining all its shell script functionality.
