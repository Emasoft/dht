# Test Fixes Progress Report

## Fixes Completed

### 1. Python Migration Import Paths
**Issue**: Tests were trying to import modules as `modules.*` instead of `DHT.modules.*`
**Fix**: Updated all import paths in `test_python_migration_completeness.py` to use correct paths:
- Changed from `modules.guardian_prefect` to `DHT.modules.guardian_prefect`
- Added `sys.path` manipulation to include the src directory
- Fixed `test_main_entry_point_exists` to look in the correct directory

### 2. Test Helper Path Resolution
**Issue**: `find_dht_root()` and `find_dht_modules_dir()` were looking for old directory structure
**Fix**: Updated `test_helpers.py` to support new UV-style layout:
- Look for `src/DHT` instead of just `DHT`
- Support both old and new layouts for compatibility

### 3. UV Prefect Tasks Logger Issues
**Issue**: Functions were using `logger` without defining it (assigned to `_` instead)
**Fix**: Changed all occurrences of `_ = _get_logger()` to `logger = _get_logger()` in:
- `list_python_versions()`
- `ensure_python_version()`
- `create_virtual_environment()`
- `install_dependencies()`
- And all other functions in the module

## Remaining Issues to Fix

### 1. Python File Size Violations (22 files)
- These files exceed the 10KB limit specified in CLAUDE.md
- This is a technical debt issue that requires refactoring

### 2. Project Type Detector Issues
- Not detecting Django projects correctly (0.0 confidence instead of 0.9+)
- Likely an issue with the detection logic or test fixtures

### 3. UV Integration Shell Script Tests
- Tests expect UV to be available in specific ways
- May need to update test expectations or mock UV availability

### 4. System Taxonomy Edge Cases
- WSL availability on Linux (known issue per test comment)
- Performance test expecting <200 tools but getting 233

### 5. Python Efficiency Tests
- Missing encoding declarations in some files
- Code complexity issues (84 complex functions found)

## Next Steps

1. Fix the most critical issues first:
   - Project type detector logic
   - Remaining import/path issues

2. Address technical debt:
   - File size violations (requires careful refactoring)
   - Code complexity issues

3. Update test expectations for environment-specific tests:
   - UV availability tests
   - System taxonomy edge cases

## Test Status Summary

After these fixes, we expect:
- **Fixed**: ~20-30 more tests
- **Remaining**: ~30-40 tests (mostly technical debt and environment-specific)
- **Target**: >90% test pass rate after addressing critical issues
