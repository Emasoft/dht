# Development Helper Toolkit (DHT)

This directory contains the core scripts and modules for the Development Helper Toolkit (DHT).
DHT is a portable, project-independent toolkit that provides standardized development workflows,
environment management, and project automation.

## Structure

- `dhtl.sh`: The main launcher script for DHT. All commands are run through this.
- `dhtl.bat`: Windows batch wrapper for `dhtl.sh`.
- `modules/`: Contains various shell script modules that provide DHT's functionality.
  - `orchestrator.sh`: Loads all other modules.
  - `dhtl_init.sh`: Handles project initialization (`dhtl init`) and setup (`dhtl setup`).
  - `dhtl_uv.sh`: Manages Python virtual environments and dependencies using `uv`.
  - `dhtl_diagnostics.sh`: Gathers environment information and generates reports.
  - `dhtl_secrets.sh`: Handles detection and setup of required secrets.
  - ... and many others for linting, testing, building, etc.
- `tests/`: Contains tests for DHT itself (pytest for Python parts, BATS/shell for scripts).
- `.dht_environment_report.json`: Machine-readable report of the project environment (generated by `dhtl setup` or `dhtl env`).

## Usage

DHT is typically invoked via the `dhtl` alias (available when a DHT-managed virtual environment
is activated) or by running the launcher script from the project root (`./dhtl.sh` or `dhtl.bat`).

```bash
# From an activated virtual environment:
dhtl <command> [options]

# From the project root:
./dhtl.sh <command> [options]  # macOS/Linux/Git Bash
.\dhtl.bat <command> [options] # Windows CMD/PowerShell
```

### Key Commands

- `dhtl init`: Initializes DHT in a new or existing project. Creates necessary configs,
  sets up a virtual environment, installs dev tools, and runs diagnostics.
- `dhtl setup`: Sets up or updates the virtual environment, installs dev tools, runs diagnostics,
  configures the `dhtl` alias, and checks/instructs on secrets for the current project.
- `dhtl env`: Runs diagnostics and displays environment information.
- `dhtl test_dht`: Runs DHT's internal self-tests.
- `dhtl help`: Shows available commands.

Refer to the main project `README.md` or run `dhtl help` for a full list of commands.
