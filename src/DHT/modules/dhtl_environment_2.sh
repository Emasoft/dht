# NOTE: find_virtual_env removed. Canonical version is in environment.sh
# NOTE: setup_command removed. Canonical version is in dhtl_init.sh
# NOTE: setup_environment removed. Canonical logic is in dhtl_init.sh (setup_uv).
# NOTE: venv_command removed. Redundant with 'dhtl setup' or needs significant rework to use canonical functions.
